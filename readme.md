🎯 Goal

Topic-wise mastery: Cover every fundamental DSA topic such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.

Pattern-level practice: Learn the recurring patterns that appear in coding interviews (like sliding window, two pointers, binary search on answer, etc.).

MAANG-focused questions: Practice questions that are frequently asked by top tech companies.

Progressive learning: Start from easy → medium → hard difficulty and systematically level up your problem-solving skills.

💡 Preparation Tips

Start with concept clarity before jumping into questions.

Practice 5–10 problems/day consistently for pattern recognition.

Analyze your mistakes carefully and redo the problem after 2–3 days.

Regularly time yourself to simulate interview conditions.

Focus on writing clean and optimal code, explaining your logic as if in an interview.

Use DayWisePractice + Notes to maintain a strong revision habit.
